# Seven Languages in Seven Weeks Notes

*Notes for the book 'Seven Languages in Seven Weeks' by Bruce A. Tate.*

## Introduction

The introduction goes through the presentation of the book and how you may want
to approach learning from it, along with general information about why each
language was chosen because of their features, (1)typing model, and/or
(2)programming model.

*(1) The typing model shapes the way you attack a problem and controls the way
a language works. There can be strong/weak or static/dynamic typing.*

*(2) The programming model tells you if the language is functional, Object
Oriented (OO), or procedural.*

Tate suggests that when learning a new language/framework to look for a quick
interactive tool. This allows for experiencing the language in a controlled and
guided way, or you can go off script and explore on your own.

When choosing the languages (and learning them!), think about **design
constructs**, **core data structures**, and core features which make the
language unique, such as BEAM in Erlang.

### Why these 7 languages?
// TODO

An important quote from Tate for learning the languages in the book
(or any new language) that stuck out for me was:

*"If you look online for the answers before trying to  code the exercises
yourself, you'll fail. You will want to **try the exercises first**, fully
recognizing that **you'll fail a few of them**. Learning **syntax** is always
easier than learning **reasoning**"*
